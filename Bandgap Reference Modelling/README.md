## Designing the Bandgap Reference Circuit

#### Following parameters to begin with:

Supply Voltage (DC) -> 1.75V <br>
Reference Resistance -> 50KΩ (ohms) <br>
Resistance near PTAT circuit -> 33KΩ (ohms) <br>
Temparature range -> -45°C to 125°C <br>
Output voltage -> 1.6V <br>
Runiq bias out 677 <br>
